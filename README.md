Hello friends, are you as annoyed as I am about the removal of Pantone colours from the Adobe suite?

Fortunately I have a backup of the Solid Coated and Uncoated books from a previous version of Illustrator, which is still available under my paid Creative Cloud license â€” and probably yours too.

These were inspired by recent corporate shenanigans which made life much more difficult for the two Pantone colours I sometimes need to use.
